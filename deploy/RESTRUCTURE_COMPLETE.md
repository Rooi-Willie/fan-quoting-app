# ✅ Repository Restructure - Complete

**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESS**  
**Date:** October 16, 2025

## 🎯 What Was Done

### Main Change
Moved the `deploy/` folder from `Aux_Fan_Quoting_App/deploy/` to `fan-quoting-app/deploy/`, making it part of the git repository.

### Documentation Organization
Created `fan-quoting-app/deploy/docs/` folder and moved all deployment documentation there:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `QUICK_START.md`
- `GITIGNORE_GUIDE.md`

## 🔒 Security Verification

### ✅ Protected Files (Ignored by Git)

```bash
# Run this to verify:
cd fan-quoting-app
git check-ignore -v deploy/config.yaml
```

**Output:**
```
.gitignore:16:deploy/config.yaml        deploy/config.yaml
```

✅ **CONFIRMED:** Passwords are protected!

### Files That Are Ignored
- ✅ `deploy/config.yaml` (contains passwords)
- ✅ `ui/.streamlit/secrets.toml` (contains API key)
- ✅ `deploy/cloud_sql_proxy.exe` (binary file)
- ✅ All `__pycache__/` folders
- ✅ All `*.pyc` files
- ✅ All `.env` files
- ✅ All `venv/` folders

### Files That Are Tracked
- ✅ All Python deployment scripts (`.py`)
- ✅ All documentation (`.md`)
- ✅ `Dockerfile.api`
- ✅ `requirements.txt`
- ✅ All application code (`api/`, `ui/`)

---

## 🚀 How to Use the New Structure

### Working Directory
**Always work from the `fan-quoting-app` directory:**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\bjviv\OneDrive\Work\Work 2021\Fan_Quoting_Software\Aux_Fan_Quoting_App\fan-quoting-app"
```

### Running Deployment Scripts
```bash
# From fan-quoting-app directory:
python deploy/1_setup_gcp.py
python deploy/2_init_database.py
python deploy/3_deploy_api.py
python deploy/4_deploy_ui.py
```

### Viewing Documentation
```bash
# From fan-quoting-app directory:
notepad deploy\docs\DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
notepad deploy\docs\QUICK_START.md
notepad deploy\docs\GITIGNORE_GUIDE.md
```

### Managing Resources
```bash
# From fan-quoting-app directory:
python deploy/6_manage_resources.py --action status
python deploy/6_manage_resources.py --action stop
python deploy/6_manage_resources.py --action start
```

---

## 🗑️ Cleanup Required

The old files are still in `Aux_Fan_Quoting_App/` and can be **safely deleted**:

```bash
# Navigate to parent directory
cd "c:\Users\bjviv\OneDrive\Work\Work 2021\Fan_Quoting_Software\Aux_Fan_Quoting_App"

# Delete old deploy folder
rmdir /s deploy

# Delete old documentation
del DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
del QUICK_START.md
del GITIGNORE_GUIDE.md
del GIT_SETUP_GUIDE.md

# Delete old root .gitignore (no longer needed)
del .gitignore
```

**⚠️ Important:** Only delete these after verifying the new structure works!

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before committing, verify:

- [x] All deployment scripts are in `fan-quoting-app/deploy/`
- [x] All documentation is in `fan-quoting-app/deploy/docs/`
- [x] `deploy/config.yaml` is ignored by git
- [x] `ui/.streamlit/secrets.toml` is ignored by git
- [x] All Python scripts are tracked by git
- [x] Documentation has correct path references
- [x] `.gitignore` has all necessary exclusions

**Status:** ✅ **ALL VERIFIED**

cd fan-quoting-app
git status --short
