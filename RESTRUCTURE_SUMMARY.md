---

## 🔄 Updated Files

### 1. `.gitignore`
**Location:** `fan-quoting-app/.gitignore`

**Added:**
```gitignore
# Deployment secrets (SECURITY - DO NOT COMMIT!)
deploy/config.yaml
deploy/cloud_sql_proxy.exe
deploy/cloud_sql_proxy
```

### 2. `deploy/README.md`
- ✅ Updated with new directory structure
- ✅ Added comprehensive quick start
- ✅ Added daily operations guide
- ✅ Updated documentation links

### 3. `deploy/docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ Updated file structure diagram
- ✅ Updated paths to reflect new location
- ✅ Commands remain the same (relative paths work)

### 4. `deploy/docs/GITIGNORE_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ Updated to reflect single `.gitignore` file
- ✅ Removed references to `Aux_Fan_Quoting_App/.gitignore`
- ✅ Updated verification steps
- ✅ Updated all path references

### 5. `deploy/docs/QUICK_START.md`
- ✅ No changes needed (uses relative paths)

---

## 🔒 Security Update

The `.gitignore` now protects:
- ✅ `deploy/config.yaml` (database passwords, API keys)
- ✅ `ui/.streamlit/secrets.toml` (API key)
- ✅ `deploy/cloud_sql_proxy.exe` (binary)
- ✅ All Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- ✅ Virtual environments (`venv/`)

---

## 🎯 Benefits of New Structure

### 1. **Git Tracking**
- All deployment scripts are now tracked by git
- Easy to version control deployment changes
- Can collaborate on deployment improvements

### 2. **Self-Contained**
- Everything related to the app is in one folder
- Easy to clone and deploy
- No need to move `.git` folder

### 3. **Organized Documentation**
- All deployment docs in `deploy/docs/`
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to find and maintain

### 4. **Better Security**
- Single `.gitignore` file protects all secrets
- No risk of missing files in nested `.gitignore`
- Easier to verify security

---

## ⚠️ Important: Old Files

The old files in `Aux_Fan_Quoting_App/deploy/` can be **safely deleted** after verifying the new structure works.

**To clean up:**
```bash
# Navigate to parent directory
cd "c:\Users\bjviv\OneDrive\Work\Work 2021\Fan_Quoting_Software\Aux_Fan_Quoting_App"

# Delete old deploy folder
rmdir /s deploy

# Delete old documentation files
del DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
del QUICK_START.md
del GITIGNORE_GUIDE.md
del GIT_SETUP_GUIDE.md
del .gitignore
```

**Note:** The root `.gitignore` is no longer needed since git is inside `fan-quoting-app/`.

---

## 🚀 Using the New Structure

### Navigate to Project Root
```bash
cd "c:\Users\bjviv\OneDrive\Work\Work 2021\Fan_Quoting_Software\Aux_Fan_Quoting_App\fan-quoting-app"

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check File Structure
```bash
cd fan-quoting-app
dir deploy
dir deploy\docs
dir deploy\utils
```

### 2. Verify Git Ignores
```bash
git status --ignored
# Should show deploy/config.yaml as ignored
```

### 3. Test Deployment Script
```bash
python deploy/1_setup_gcp.py --help
# Should show help message (if implemented)
```
